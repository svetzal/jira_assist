#
#
# A great example of how not to test a gen-ai system!
#
# This test uses an LLM to compare lists of personal goals. It does so through a prompt like this:
#             LLMMessage(role="user",
#                        content=f"List the goals that are in the first list but not in the second list.\n\n"
#                                f"First List: {goals1.model_dump_json()}\n\n"
#                                f"Second List: {goals2.model_dump_json()}")
#
# This requires the llm to do a bunch of correlation within its context in order to mimic logic (this but not that)
# and it will get "creative" every time, because it cannot logic. However it is useful because it can recognize similar
# meaning in differently phrased objectives.
#
# These pytests will fail nearly every time.
#
# What to do instead?
# Well, I'm not sure what path will yield me the best results right now, but the reason this whole project exists is
# to push my brain around building a semantic system around this objective alignment idea and exploring the boundaries
# of where an LLM can be useful, where I can explore simple vector similarity instead (like RAG would do in a chatbot),
# and any other techniques that strike me as I wander.
#
# "Not all who wander are lost." âˆª "Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves."
