# JiraAssist

This repository is currently kind of meta. I am writing a tool I'm currently calling JiraAssist in order to help teams better focus on writing good software that aligns to the needs of their users.

I want the tool to be driven by a specific structural definition of their software and its purpose. JiraAssist effectively models this structural definition, and then uses it to assess and potentially modify their Jira project in order to better reflect their goals and the goals of the users of their software.

So, of course, I am using JiraAssist to develop JiraAssist. If you know me, this will not be a surprise.
